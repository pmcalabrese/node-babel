# Node.js Babel Boilerplate
A minimal boilerplate for running Node.js with Babel.

## 1. Clone project

    git clone git@github.com:pmcalabrese/node-babel.git

## 2. Install dependencies

    npm install

The workflow consist of running the compiler with:

    npm run watch

This command will watch the files in the src folder and automatically compile them and put in the dist folder.

    npm start

## 4. Build

You also have the option to build once with

    npm run build
